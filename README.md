# commonlisp-raycaster
A rudimentary raycaster created in commonlisp using lispbuilder-sdl

## Requirements
In order to run this you need quicklisp installed and set to automatically be initialized
Hopefully lispbuilder-sdl should be initialized when the program is ran but yeh.
For this I'm using SBCL, not sure if it will work on other common lisp variants but yeah.

## Features
This is still a very obvious work and progress, it will honestly likely end up being ditched but I'll leave it to serve as a silly thing if anyone else wants to look, it's likely not written the best as I'm still learning lisp but whatever.
Also I'm putting this here as it may server as a handy guide to anyone trying to get a grasp of lispbuilder-sdl and they need some examples of stuff because I did a lot of glancing at other lispbuilder-sdl projects to figure out how to use it properly, I'll likely put some actual documentation for parts if I continue this but yeah.

## Credits
This is pretty much just a lisp-ified version of this tutorial https://github.com/vinibiavatti1/RayCastingTutorial so thanks to them, it's a good tutorial.

Hope you enjoy seeing my descent into madness :3
